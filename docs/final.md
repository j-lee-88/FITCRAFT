# Project Summary
Use another level-two header to start aProject Summarysection. Write a few paragraphssummarizing the goals of the project (yes, yet again, but updated/improved version from the status). Inparticular, make sure that the problem is clearly defined here, and feel free to use an image or so to set upthe task. Part of the evaluation will be on how well you are able to motivate the challenges of the problem,i.e. why is it not trivial, and why you need AI/ML algorithms to solve it.

# Approaches
Use another level-two header calledApproaches, In this section, describe both the baselinesand your proposed approach(es). Describe precisely what the advantages and disadvantages of each are,for example, why one might be more accurate, need less data, take more time, overfit, and so on. Includeenough technical information to be able to (mostly) reproduce your project, in particular, use pseudocodeand equations as much as possible.

# Evaluation
An important aspect of your project, as I’ve mentioned several times now, is evaluating yourproject. Be clear and precise about describing the evaluation setup, for both quantitative and qualitativeresults. Present the results to convince the reader that you havesolvedthe problem, to whatever extent youclaim you have. Use plots, charts, tables, screenshots, figures, etc. as needed. I expect you will need at leasta few paragraphs to describe each type of evaluation that you perform.

# References
Make a list of work you’re citing in your description above (starting with a level-two header).This should include any papers you think are relevant, third-party source code you used, sources for any ofthe images that you didn’t create, and any other websites/links you found useful.
